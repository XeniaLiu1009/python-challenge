Hi, this is Xenia :)

I followed the instructions and created two different folders named "PyBank" and "PyPoll". These two folders have the exact same structure. Each of the folders has "Resouces", "main.py", and "analysis". The "Resource" folder has the given data, and the "main.py" file is my python code. Besides this, the "analysis" folder includes the screenshot of the terminal output and the txt output.

Thank you so much!
