Hi, this is Xenia :)

I followed instruction and created two different folder named "PyBank" and "PyPoll". These two folder has exactly same structure. Each of the folder has "Resouces", "main.py" and "analysis". The "Resource" folder has the given data and the "main.py" is my python code. Besides this, the "analysis" folder includes the photoshot of terminal and the txt output.

Thank you so much!
